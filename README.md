# Machine Learning Question Categorization on Stack Overflow

## Project Overview

The "Machine Learning Question Categorization on Stack Overflow" project aims to automatically categorize Stack Overflow questions as either related to machine learning or not. This classification helps users efficiently identify and access machine learning-related content among the diverse set of questions on the platform.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Code repository/`: Root directory containing project-related files and directories.
- `DVC/`: Configuration and management for Data Version Control (DVC).
- `DagsHub/`: DagsHub integration for collaboration and version control of machine learning pipelines.
- `Git/`: Git configuration and version control.
- `MlFlow/`: MLFlow integration for model tracking and management.
- `venv/`: Virtual environment folder for managing Python dependencies.
- `data/`: Directory to store dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and model development.
- `outputs/`: Directory to store output files, including trained models and logs.
- `dvcignore`: DVC-specific ignore file listing files/directories excluded from DVC tracking.
- `gitignore`: Git-specific ignore file listing files/directories excluded from version control.
- `output.dvc`: DVC metadata file tracking the output directory.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the machine learning pipeline.

## Usage

### Automated Question Categorization

The project's main script `main.py` contains the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model serialization.

### Collaborative Workflow

The integration of DVC, Git, and DagsHub ensures proper version control and collaboration. DVC manages data versions, Git tracks code versions, and DagsHub facilitates collaboration on machine learning pipelines.

### Model Tracking and Management

MLFlow integration in the `MlFlow/` directory allows you to track, manage, and deploy machine learning models, simplifying the model lifecycle.

## Benefits

- **Efficient Learning**: Users can quickly find and access machine learning-related content on Stack Overflow, enhancing their learning experience.
- **Focused Collaboration**: Experts can collaborate more effectively by engaging with relevant content.
- **Insights and Analysis**: Researchers gain insights into machine learning trends by analyzing questions and discussions.
- **Reproducibility**: Proper version control and integration ensure reproducibility of experiments and models.

## Getting Started

1. Set up a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project: `python main.py`.
